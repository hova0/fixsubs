00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,369
Long ago, this land w as
once cal led Ne verland .

2
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,482
lt w as a beautiful parad ise
w ith abundant g reenery.

3
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:57,657
H umans, demons, and gods w ere
al l eq ual ly feared and respected

4
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,352
i n this vi rg i n land .

5
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,795
But as ti me passed ,

6
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,162
the w orld found itself fig hti ng
o ver i ncreasi ng pow er.

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,032
The Ne verland War took o ver
tw enty mi l l ion l ives.

8
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,464
l n the gg 7 th y ear of the
Demon Century,

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,877
a lone hero captured the Tenmak en.

10
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,949
No one had e ver i mag i ned
that such an e vent

11
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:27,648
w ould trigger another outbreak of
the Ne verland War.

12
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,665
What's this?

13
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,835
The forest is afraid .

14
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:48,284
S o, this is the sw ord that can destroy
the Demon Ki ng J anus,

15
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,427
the Tenmak en.

16
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,489
l p pushi roia cannot hold the
battle l i ne and is i n retreat.

17
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,226
S hal l w e pursue them?

18
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,825
lt has not been found y et.

19
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,792
We must block the Rig hteous
Army for now.

20
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,226
l 'l l organize a unit for pursuit.

21
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,218
Where's H i ro? Where is she?

22
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,791
Pri ncess H i ro has gone to tak e care

23
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,261
of the old monster that settled
i n the cany on gorge.

24
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,929
You let her go alone?

25
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,432
Did n't w e decide that, once
the battle w as o ver,

26
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,900
w e'd ex orcise it together?

27
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,334
Yes, but. . . Lady Prana!

28
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,414
S ister? !

29
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,268
Where's Father?

30
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,600
H e's resti ng after the battle.

31
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:50,636
Father and l both thi nk it's
too soon for y ou to fig ht.

32
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,901
Please understand .

33
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:58,616
l know, but it's more pai nful
for me not to fig ht.

34
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,016
You can't possi bly understand , S ister.

35
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,474
This is such a g reat op portunity ! Drat !

36
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,576
Where'd that N i nja creep go? !

37
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,067
We'l l miss out on this
chance of a l ifeti me.

38
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,881
Zaky o, hel p me look for hi m !

39
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,281
lf y ou get too panick ed , y ou'l l

40
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,120
Wel l , it'd be y our fault, S ato !
Where the hel l are y ou?

41
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,021
That should fi nish thi ngs off.

42
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,195
l don't sense any more
mal icious spi rits.

43
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,935
lt's a w aste to hi re mercenaries l i k e us

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,070
for such a si mple mission,

45
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,143
May be.

46
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,309
Let's get goi ng .

47
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,052
But aren't these spi rits y our al l ies?

48
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,619
The spi rits here are either deserters
or nig ht prow lers.

49
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,653
They're more l i k ely to be
y our associates.

50
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,152
That's a bit harsh.
We're mercenaries.

51
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,665
We mak e a l ivi ng w ith
our fig hti ng ski l ls.

52
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,361
We'l l accept any job,

00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,196
as long as they acknow ledge
our ski l ls.

54
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,775
You sure y ou're al l rig ht w ith this?

55
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:10,504
You know, Pri ncess, y our sister

56
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:15,288
but fig hti ng these losers doesn't

to earni ng w hat w e've been paid .

58
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,986
No kidd i ng . We're pros.

59
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,594
We can't accept that ki nd of
money for doi ng nothi ng .

60
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,095
Then, do as y ou please. Farew el l .

61
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,372
S he's a cold fish.

62
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,772
S omethi ng's not rig ht here.

63
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:49,218
What w as my sister thi nki ng?
S he w as so cal m,

64
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,046
but then she suddenly cal led i n
these mercenaries.

65
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,583
l 'm entrusti ng y ou w ith this, H i ro.

66
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,427
Why w ould she suddenly send me off

67
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,692
to the Western Forest w ith
these mercenaries?

68
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,889
S he's ne ver done anythi ng

69
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,628
Was l j ust i n the w ay?
That could n't be.

70
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,115
You demons w ho defi le the earth,

71
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,187
see if y ou can w ithstand the
sacred l ig ht of this sw ord !

72
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,069
Chiffon !

73
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,299
l 'm fi ne. Come on. We've got to hurry.

74
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,610

75
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,608
The g uerri l la forces from the Rig hteous
Army ha ve fi nal ly come.

76
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,213
lf only the units w e sent

77
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,420
but this ti me, they w on't
return q uickly enoug h.

78
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,886
S o, they ha ve the sw ord?

79
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,524
That most pow erful of al l sw ords,
the Tenmak en.

80
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:48,399
That's a fancy scythe y ou got there.
Anythi ng special?

81
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,876
The Gate of H ea ven.

82
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,112
lt cuts the soul aw ay, al low i ng
it to rise to H ea ven.

83
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,636
lt's my sister's fa vorite w eapon.

84
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,915
Did y ou hear that? lt's the. . .

85
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,421
l 'd been w onderi ng about it. The only
ones w ho can use such thi ngs

86
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:06,392
are either the Gods of Death
or the Demon Ki ngs.

87
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,827
S o, w hat's that mean?

88
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,429
S he's either a God of Death
or a Demon Ki ng?

89
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,920
With a face l i k e that?

90
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:20,706
Yeah, but that's a major scythe.
lt's got to be sacred .

91
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,834
And her monster-l i k e left
hand bothers me too.

92
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,446
S o, Pri ncess, w ho the heck are y ou?

93
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,151
l 'm the Demon Ki ng J anus's

94
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,546
Did n't my sister tel l y ou?

95
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,717
We had no idea!

96
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,688
S o she w as entrusted to us
by order of the G reat Ki ng .

97
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,624
No w onder w e w ere
paid so generously.

98
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,704
But it's strange. Why w ould they
hi re mercenaries

99
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,138
l i k e us to protect the Pri ncess?

100
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,244
Let's go back to the castle.

101
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,711
l ha ve a bad feel i ng .

102
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,385
The castle !

103
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,216
Amazi ng ! l s it some ki nd of explosive?

104
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,988
No, explosives don't
g low l i k e that.

105
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,317
lt has to be a ki nd of sorcery,
some very pow erful mag ic.

106
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:20,058
Watch out, Pri ncess. There's
somethi ng underfoot.

107
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,704
What's this? lt's huge !

108
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:42,288
l don't w hat y ou're doi ng here now,
but l 'm i n a hurry,

00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,756

110
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,540

00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,579
They're fi nal ly here.

113
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,581
lf it's the last thi ng l do,

114
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,315
l must seal the sw ord ,
the Tenmak en, aw ay.

115
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,663
That sw ord is the most pow erful
sw ord i n the w orld ,

116
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,360
created by the gods solely for
my destruction.

117
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,630
lt holds the most pow erful
forces of the hea vens.

118
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:40,607
The gods know no bounds w hen
it comes to those they hate.

119
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,573
They've alw ay s been that w ay.

00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,487
Not only w ould l be ki l led , but
the w orld w ould be destroy ed .

124
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,396
We're here.

125
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,672
Demon Ki ng J anus !

For the sak e of al l humanity,

130
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,960
This abi l ity to i nstantly

131
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,494
These pow ers of regeneration are

132
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,428
Damn ! l ha ve to get the Pri ncess

00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,408
but this one is awful ly fast
for such a big creature.

134
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,605
Even if the Pri ncess escapes,
it can sti l l catch up w ith her.

135
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,280

Father!

151
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,695
Now it's y our turn to rule
the w orld , humans.

152
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,438
O nce the pow er of my

the pow ers of the monsters

But l w i l l tak e this sw ord w ith me,

Now, w i l l y ou be able

159
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,322

00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,406
What, that thi ng? Piece of cak e.

187
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,546
The Demon Ki ng J anus is dead !
Retreat, now.

188
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,013
Yes !

189
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,196
The w orld is goi ng to

190
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,632
The fi ne balance that my father

Now humans e veryw here w i l l rise

194
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,680
H umans rely on the gods too much.

195
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,638
Demons ha ve alw ay s ruled the w orld .

Besides, l sti l l ha ven't

H ow many bi rthday s has it

207
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:53,529

a sw ord w hich humans perhaps

218
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:57,976
The Demon Ki ng J anus, w ho

Command of the Demon Forces fel l
to the y oung Pri ncess H i ro.

221
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:11,396
But pow erful nations could not

222
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:55,242
l w as born of the union betw een
a human and a demon.

223
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,747
H i ro !

224
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:42,455
May mee. . .

225
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:28,869
lt's the chi ld of a demon !

00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:30,336
Ki l l her!

227
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:32,306

Ki l l her!

233
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,534
The situation is extremely serious.

234
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:10,711
The news of the Demon
Ki ng J anus' death

235
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:13,547
at the hand of the hero Chiffon
has spread w orldw ide.

236
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:15,516
l n a desi re to tak e

237
00:28:15,516 --> 00:28:18,713
the humans are plotti ng to destroy
the remai ni ng Demon Forces.

238
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:22,055
J ust the countries that are clearly
mobi l izi ng forces are :

239
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:27,693
H el l hanpool's Vang le Band its,
Logeon's Flauster Forces,

240
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,830
the Muromachi Army,
the S i l i neeg Knig hts,

241
00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:36,432
S un Rio's Mi l l ia Forces, and
AX's Dome Battle Force.

242
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:38,839
No new ly reformed Demon Forces

243
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,742
could w ithstand that ki nd
of an onslaug ht.

l n other w ords. . .

245
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,104
l n other w ords, the demon race
itself is i n danger of exti nction.

246
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,917
Why? Why d id my father ha ve
to d ie, Bai rd the 1 3th?

247
00:28:58,192 --> 00:29:00,922
You could say it w as j ust the ti mes.

248
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:04,561
The Demon Ki ng J anus
w as too pow erful .

249
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:09,993
The humans bel ie ved J anus
control led al l the demons.

250
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:13,874
That may ha ve been true, but i n real ity

251
00:29:13,874 --> 00:29:17,002
no one could rule the people
w ith fear alone.

252
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:20,648
You could say J anus o verstep ped
his position.

253
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:23,617
Bastard ! This from the second i n
command of the Demon Forces? !

254
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:26,379
S o, w hat do y ou propose w e do?

255
00:29:28,222 --> 00:29:31,385
A number of human nations are
w i l l i ng to form an al l iance.

256
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:34,423
Why not joi n forces w ith them?

257
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:37,892
That w ay the humans w on't
be so q uick to attack.

258
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:39,833
There is no such country !

259
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:42,131
H umans and demons

You're w rong , Pri ncess.

but to lose so many l ives

267
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:08,195
May mee, our enemies'

268
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:11,687
so that they can then destroy us.

269

Wi l l the w orld be a better place?

297
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:43,206
Yes, of course. lt'l l be a w orld w ith
one genui nely superior race.

298
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:46,137
l s there anythi ng l can do
to assist y ou, J addo?

299
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,581
That's w hy l had y ou summoned ,
to tak e the throne.

300
00:33:58,358 --> 00:33:59,825
l . . .

301
00:34:01,695 --> 00:34:03,720
w ant to hel p y ou.

302
00:34:13,073 --> 00:34:15,803
lt's a mi racle. lt's the only explanation.

303
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:19,068
You're rig ht. That w as w ay too close.

304
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,949
lf they had n't retreated because
of Zaki phon's bra vado,

305
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:23,974
w e'd ha ve been creamed .

306
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,981
With Zaki phon critical ly w ounded
and unable to fig ht,

307
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:36,626
and only a hund red recruits left, w hat
do y ou w ant to do, Pri ncess?

308
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:43,965
lt's ti me that y ou told us w hy y our
rei nforcements w ere late.

309
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:46,807
My father has his ow n ideas.

310
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:49,105
lf w e had sent more troops
i nto that chaos,

311
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:51,868
our casual ities w ould ha ve
been e ven g reater.

312
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:56,649
S orry.

313
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,952
For now, it'd be w ise to
fol low Bai rd's plan.

314
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:06,222
l d id n't joi n the Demon Army
j ust to get my self ki l led .

315
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:10,560
That's because y ou're a human.

316
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,923
lt's not surprisi ng that y ou'd
betray the demons.

317
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:15,498
S o, go. Go on back to the humans.

318
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,136
You hard-headed , stubborn fool !

319
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:20,666
H ey ! Chick! Wait !

320
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:24,407
You know y ou can go too,
if y ou w ant.

321
00:35:26,346 --> 00:35:29,873
The only one hung up on humans
and demons is y ou, Pri ncess !

322
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:38,791
Do y ou ha ve a plan?

323
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:43,995
H ow could l ? But as it is, w e'l l d ie.

324
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:45,988
Chick, y ou. . .

325
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:49,934
S ato, stay here w ith the
Pri ncess and Zaki phon.

326
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:52,764
O ne traitor is enoug h.

327
00:35:53,073 --> 00:35:54,540
Chick.

329
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:48,095

332
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,197
Yes.

333
00:36:56,203 --> 00:36:59,104
H ow can l send my troops i n

334
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:02,172
w ithout any proof that y ou are
an official envoy?

335
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:04,711
Azalea, Pri ncess of the
Deep Forest Elves,

336
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,805
d uri ng my tra vels, l heard of y our
ad mi nistration's pol icies,

337
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:10,709
that y ou are seeki ng peace,

338
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:15,478
that y ou are w i l l i ng to fig ht to
protect the beauty of the land .

339
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,458
And so?

340
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,619
H i ro, the Q ueen of the new ly
formed Demon Forces,

341
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:22,952
isn't someone w ho desi res w ar.

342
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,996
l n her position as the hei r
to the Demon Ki ng J anus,

343
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:28,168
she has been forced i nto battle,

344
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:30,602
but her desi re is the same as
y ours, Pri ncess Azalea.

345
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:35,332
Envoy from a faraw ay
land , w hat is peace?

346
00:37:36,143 --> 00:37:41,080
The beauty of this forest doesn't
come from peace.

347
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:46,610
l n order to reap the
blessi ngs of nature,

348
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:50,414
there is much w e ha ve to do.

349
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:56,053
lf w e can only reap a harvest
after w e plant the fields,

350
00:37:56,663 --> 00:37:59,291
can that sti l l be cal led nature?

351
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:03,170
l don't understand w hat y ou mean.

352
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,539
What it means is that l can't i mag i ne

353
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,632
that the demon throne thi nks the
same w ay as l do.

354
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:09,575
But. . .

355
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,971
Answ er my q uestion, please.

356
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:14,806
Where is the proof that y ou are the
official envoy of the demons?

357
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:16,983
l can get proof,

358
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:19,186
but w e must hurry.

359
00:38:19,186 --> 00:38:20,821

00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:34,229
But aren't y ou a human too? !

S tay back! You're no match for hi m.

375
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:25,511
Very cle ver, Your H ig hness

380
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,427
lf w e let the l p pushi roia gai n

00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:44,737
there's no turni ng back.

382
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,735
That w on't be very amusi ng
for either of us.

383
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,899
Pri ncess Azalea!

385
00:39:55,215 --> 00:40:00,016
Wel l , that's a bit harsh. Feel i ng
a bit neurotic today?

386
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:03,924
Please, Pri ncess Azalea,
please reconsider!

387

391
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:39,152
Listen up ! The enemy is at the

392
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,586
Protect the border w ith y our l ife.

Why d id y ou lea ve me al l alone?

397
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:09,412
Father? S ister? The throne is
too much for me.

398
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:22,261
We must fig ht agai nst the Demon

00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:27,705
Must w e destroy al l the demons?

401
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:32,574
H umans need to be go verned
by the proper leaders.

402
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:36,473
l n an ideal w orld , demons

403
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:57,001
What is it, Chiffon? Why such a

00:41:57,237 --> 00:41:59,205
What? Nothi ng .

Go !

00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:19,059
lt's an ambush !

00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:19,492
Don't panic ! There aren't

J addo? l 've ne ver heard of y ou.

421
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:11,870
J anus banished me.

422
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:15,677
Feari ng l mig ht become

00:43:16,149 --> 00:43:18,242
the father abandoned the son.

Now, al l that remai ns is for y ou to

w hen Father refused
to g ive it to y ou?

429
00:43:34,734 --> 00:43:37,066
You only w ant the throne for
